# Bit Manipulation Library

This is part of my self studies, at the time of writing, I am working on bits, binary and hexadecimals. I am only on the bits and binary part now, and this is my bit and binary manipulation library.

## Documentation

#### Basic per bit manipulation
```bit_is_set``` Checks if the bit at the index via the argument _bit_position_ is set, returns a bool.

```bit_set``` Sets the bit at the index via the argument _bit_position_.

```bit_unset``` Unets the bit at the index via the argument _bit_position_. 

```bit_set``` Sets the bit at the index via the argument _bit_position_. 

```bit_toggle``` Sets the bit at the index via the argument _bit_position_ to its oppposite value, toggling the bit.

#### Range bit manipulation

```extract_range``` Extracts the bits in the range starting at bit _start_ (inclusive) for _num_bits_ and returns it as a string.  

#### Printing

```binary_to_string```Returns the given varible as binary in a string.

```print_binary``` Prints the binary.

```pretty_print_binary``` Prints the binary in a pretty manner :3
